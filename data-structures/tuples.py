# tuples - store information - ()

names = ('John', 'Jude', 'Jack')
number = (1,) #for tuples when representing a single value you have to put a comma at the end so that python doesnt think you are calling a function and providing a parameter

print(names[1])

names[1] = 'Jake'  #Cannot assign to a tuple
